# Mx linear algebra

This will be my set of C libraries for doing simple matrix operations and
linear algebra.

## Why in C?
Because I want to learn! Using Python and Numpy is just simple. And, I love this language.

## Operations

### Simple Matrix Operations
- [x] Identity Matrices
- [ ] Matrix Transpose (To flip a matrix along the diagonal)
- [x] Matrix Multiplication
- [ ] Matrix Scaling
- [ ] Matrix Covariance
- [ ] Matrix Dot Product
- [ ] Matrix Dot Diagonal (computes the dot product of the diagonals of two matrices)
- [ ] Matrix Trace (Sum of elements along the diagonal)
- [ ] Matrix Mean (returns the average of each column in a matrix)
- [ ] Matrix Multiplication
